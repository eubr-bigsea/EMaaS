	 * Some people have asked why this constructor has a parameter of type {@link BibtexFile} (which in turn extends
	 * <code>BibtexNode</code>). The reason is that each BibtexNode has a reference to the <code>BibtexFile</code> which
	 * it belongs to. Of course, for the file itself that pointer is null.
	 * 
	 * By the way, it's unlikely that you need to call this constructor or any constructor for <code>BibtexNodes</code>
	 * other than <code>BibtexFile</code> directly - instead, use the <code>BibtexFile</code> as a factory.
	 * 
	 * For example, to create a <code>BibTex</code> file equivalent of this
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * ================
	 * &#64;article{test1,
	 * author="Johannes Henkel",
	 * title="README"
	 * }
	 * ================
	 * you'd do
	 * 
	 * BibtexFile bibtexFile = new BibtexFile();
	 * BibtexEntry onlyEntry = bibtexFile.makeEntry("article","test1");
	 * onlyEntry.setField("author",bibtexFile.makeString("Johannes Henkel"));
	 * onlyEntry.setField("title",bibtexFile.makeString("README"));
	 * </pre>
